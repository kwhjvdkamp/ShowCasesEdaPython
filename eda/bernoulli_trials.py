# Test this function to perform 'n' Bernoulli trials,
# with function: perform_bernoulli_trials(n, p),
# which returns the number of successes out of n Bernoulli trials,
# each of which has a probability 'p' of success.

# Think of a Bernoulli trial as a flip of a possibly biased coin.
# Specifically, each coin flip has a
# probability 'p' of landing on heads (success)
# probability '1âˆ’p' of landing tails (failure)
